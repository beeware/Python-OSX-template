Python OS/X Template
====================

A template for building Python 3.5 apps that will run under OS/X.

Using this template
-------------------

1. Install `cookiecutter`_. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

2. Run ``cookiecutter`` on the Python-OS/X template::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/pybee/Python-OSX-template

3. `Download the Python OS/X support package`_, and extract it. This
   will give you two frameworks.

   * ``OpenSSL.framework``

   * ``Python.framework``

   Alternatively, you can download the `Python-OSX-support`_ project, and
   build your own versions of these frameworks.

   These framework directories should be placed in the same directory as
   the ``app`` and ``app_packages`` directories generated by the cookiecutter
   project template - the ``Contents`` subdirectory of the main application
   bundle.

If you've done this correctly, a project called ``myproject`` should have a
directory structure that looks something like::

    My Project.app/
        Contents/
            MacOS/
                My Project

            app/
                myproject/
                    ...
            app_packages/
                ...

The top level directory should identify as an OS/X application, and can be
distributed as a standalone package.

Next steps
----------

Of course, just running Python code isn't very interesting by itself - you'll
be able to output to the console, and see that output in XCode, but if you
tap the app icon on your phone, you won't see anything - because there isn't a
visible console on an iPhone.

To do something interesting, you'll need to work with the native OS/X system
libraries to draw widgets and respond to screen taps. The `Rubicon`_
Objective C bridging library can be used to enable an easy interface with the
OS/X system libraries. You could also use the `toga`_ library to provides a
cross-platform widget toolkit that supports OS/X.

If you have any external library dependencies (like ``toga``, or anything other
third-party library), you should install the library code into the
``app_packages`` directory. This directory is the same as a  ``site_packages``
directory on a normal Python install.
